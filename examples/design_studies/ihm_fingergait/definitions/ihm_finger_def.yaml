# Manipulator Definition

# Author: Clark Teeple
# Date:   09/25/2020
# Description:
#     This finger definition is based on the 2-DOF fingers developed in our paper
#     "A Dexterous Soft Robotic Hand for Delicate In-Hand Manipulation", found at
#     (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9134855). Based on the dimensions,
#     bending stifffness, and blocked force, we can convert these measurements of
#     the physical system into the joint stiffness and masses here. We utilize a
#     world scale of 20 for numerical stabillity.

# NOTE: Remember to scale your geometry, stiffnesses, positions, and forces
# by the global scaling factor (usually 20x), but no need to scale masses.
