# Sweep Configuration

# Name:   IHM Finger Gait - Final Conversion Weights - Rubiks Cube
# Author: Clark Teeple
# Date:   10/30/2020
# Description:
#   Using the final side-to-side conversion weight (6.5), we manipulate a
#   rubiks cube (from the YCB Object Set), and sweep over camra angles to
#   find an angle that roughtly matches the picture of the real system. A
#   still image from this video is used for Figure 1 of teh SoMo ICRA paper.
