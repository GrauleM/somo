# Sweep Configuration

# Name:   IHM Finger Gait - Conversion Weight Exploration
# Author: Clark Teeple
# Date:   10/30/2020
# Description:
#   Sweep over the side-to-side conversion weight to check if intuition makes sense.
#   Based on the calibration (see docs/calibration_of_real_world_actuator.pdf), we
#   expect the side-to-side weight to be roughly 6.0. After running this sweep, we
#   see that a value of 6.5 produces the correct behvaior.
